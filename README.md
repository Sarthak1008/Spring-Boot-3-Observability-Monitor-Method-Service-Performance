The project focuses on enhancing observability within Spring Boot applications by monitoring method and service performance. This involves tracking key metrics and performance indicators to ensure optimal application health and performance.

Key Features:

Method Performance Monitoring: Implement tracking mechanisms to monitor the execution time and performance of individual methods within the application.
Service Performance Monitoring: Monitor the performance of various services and components within the Spring Boot application to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
Metric Collection: Collect relevant metrics and performance indicators, such as response times, throughput, and error rates, to gain insights into the application's behavior and performance.

Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: Java-based framework for building robust and scalable applications with ease.
Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): Utilize AOP to intercept method invocations and instrument performance monitoring logic.
